# Gå för miljön / Walk for the environment

## UX - Frontend 

This course was divided into two sections. Section one was a group project with focus on UX/UI. And the second section was individual. We implemented the prototype the group had made into actual code and made a web application.

## From idea to prototype

 🕵️‍♀️ We had 4 weeks as a new group to come up with an epic idea about how we could help people to choose more sustainable travels. \
🧠 We conducted a brain-storming session and decided to focus on how to get people to choose more sustainable options in the everyday routine.


#### Our solution
🚶 Choose to walk instead of driving the car and recieve points for the steps you make. \
👯  Compete with your colleagues. \
👣 Compare your carbon footprint by walking instead of driving.  \
✨The points you make converts in to money and you can donate to organisations without opening your wallet.  \


## Prototype

With a great teamwork we created a prototype in Figma,

Lightmode,

Darkmode,

### User-testing
👀 We interviewed some potential users. We gave them some tasks, for example to donate to an organisation or to find the dark/light mode switch. They liked the overall feel and layout. It was easy to manoeuvre. The two things we could improve were the position of the dark/light mode switch and to get more information about the app even before you get to the homepage, for example in a step-by-step wizard.


## Creating the application

The instructions we recieved for the individual project was to use HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
I decided to use,
- HTML
- JavaScript
- React
- Styled-components

✍️ Using Trello as my project managment tool I planned out three diffrent sprints (weekly sprints).

We were allowed to make fictitious features and to use hardcoded data so I decided to make a stepcounter to start with, and hardcoded data for past activites and organisations. 

👍 Because the prototype had some opportunities for improvement I made some changes in the final product. 
- A fictitious log-in. 
- The info-wizard that only shows after you create an account (the first time you use the app). 
- In the last view (/thankyou) you can only choose one button "Tillbaka" and set all data to 0. 
- One more view that you can access from the navbar, here is the dark/light mode switch locaded and the sign-out button. 



 🏃‍♀️ Next steps for my application would be to connect it to a database, for example firebase to get the user-handling to work correctly. I would also turn this into a pwa to make it feel more like an mobile-app, and connect the API from Androids built-in pedometer.
