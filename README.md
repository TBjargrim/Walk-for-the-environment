# UX - Frontend 
## From idea to product


We got 4 weeks as a new group to come up with an epic idea about how we could help people to choose more
sustainable travels.

Our solution
- Choose to walk instead of taking the car and get points for the steps you make.
- Compete with you collegues
- âœ¨Donate to organisations without open you wallet 

## Prototype

We created a prototype in Figma,

Darkmode

## Creating the application

With the instructions that we needed to use HTML/CSS/JavaScript the indivudal work started.
I decided to use,
- HTML
- JavaScript
- React
- Styled-components


## Installation


```sh
Run git clone, cd into the right folder and npm install. 
The following packages are being used:
- react-circular-progressbar
- framer-motion
- react-icons
- styled-components
```
