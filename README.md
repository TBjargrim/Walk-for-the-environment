# Gå för miljön / Walk for the environment

## UX - Frontend 

## From idea to product


We got 4 weeks as a new group to come up with an epic idea about how we could help people to choose more
sustainable travels.

### Our solution
- Choose to walk instead of taking the car and get points for the steps you make.
- Compete with you collegues
- ✨Donate to organisations without open you wallet 

## Prototype

With a great teamwork we created a prototype in Figma,

Lightmode
<a href="https://github.com"><img src="https://github.com/tbjargrim/Walk-for-the-environment/blob/main/src/Images/FigmaLight.jpg" alt="Prototype in lightmode" border="0" /></a>

Darkmode
<a href="https://github.com"><img src="https://github.com/tbjargrim/Walk-for-the-environment/blob/main/src/Images/FigmaDark.jpg" border="0" /></a>

## Creating the application

With the instructions that we needed to use HTML/CSS/JavaScript the individual work started.
I decided to use,
- HTML
- JavaScript
- React
- Styled-components


## Installation


```sh
Run git clone, cd into the right folder and npm install. 
The following packages are being used:
- framer-motion
- react-icons
- styled-components
```
